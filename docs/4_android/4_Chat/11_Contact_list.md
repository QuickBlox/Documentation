# Contact list

In QuickBlox Android SDK contact list functionality realized via ```QBRoster```. Using this model you can add users to contact list, accept or reject request and perform 
other typical functions with contacts. 

To getting ```QBRoster``` just call:
```java
QBRoster chatRoster = QBChatService.getInstance().getRoster();
```

## Contact list mode

User A sends a request to become "friends" with user B. User B accepts the friend request. And now user A and B appear in each other's roster.

<br>
But, alternatively, you can use twitter like logic. User A sends a presence subscription request to user B. Think about this more like following on twitter. 
User A is requesting permission to receive presence information from user B (following their presence). User B can accept this request, but may not be interested 
in receiving presence info from user B. Again, this is more like twitter following, but with the addition of required permission. 
So when user B accepts the request, this *only* means that user A will receive presence from user B. It does *not* mean that user B will receive presence 
from user A. Again, twitter-style, user A is now "following" user B. In diagram form, presence is flowing like this:
<br>
  A <-- B
<br>
Now, if B also wants to receive presence from user A, then user B must request this permission. And furthermore, user A must accept the request. 
Just because B has granted A permission to receive presence, doesn't mean that B gets a free pass to receive presence from A.

By default this SDK provides **twitter like** mode.

To enable Facebook like logic pass ```QBRoster.SubscriptionMode.mutual``` value when you are obtaining a roster:
```java
QBRoster chatRoster = QBChatService.getInstance().getRoster(QBRoster.SubscriptionMode.mutual, subscriptionListener);
```

## Access to the Contact list

### Main setup

To access contact list you have to obtain it and set all needed listeners:
* ```QBRosterListener``` is a listener that is fired any time a roster is changed or the presence of a user in the roster is changed (user becomes online/offline)

* ```QBSubscriptionListener``` is a listener that is fired on "subscribe" (add to contact list) request from any user.

Setting listeners to ```QBRoster```:
```java
QBRosterListener rosterListener = new QBRosterListener() {
    @Override
    public void entriesDeleted(Collection<Integer> userIds) {

    }

    @Override
    public void entriesAdded(Collection<Integer> userIds) {

    }

    @Override
    public void entriesUpdated(Collection<Integer> userIds) {

    }

    @Override
    public void presenceChanged(QBPresence presence) {

    }
};

QBSubscriptionListener subscriptionListener = new QBSubscriptionListener() {
    @Override
    public void subscriptionRequested(int userId) {

    }
};


// Do this after success Chat login
QBRoster chatRoster = QBChatService.getInstance().getRoster(QBRoster.SubscriptionMode.mutual, subscriptionListener);
chatRoster.addRosterListener(rosterListener);
```

### Access contact list users

To get users from contact list:
```java
Collection<QBRosterEntry> entries = —ÅhatRoster.getEntries();
```

```QBRosterEntry``` describes a user entity in your contact list. To get user's ID use ```getUserId()``` getter.

To check user in contact list:
```java
int userID = 45;

QBPresence presence = chatRoster.getPresence(userID);

if (presence == null) {
    // No user in your roster
    return;
}
```

To request user's status (online/offline):
```java
QBPresence presence = ...;
if (presence.getType() == QBPresence.Type.online) {
    // User is online
}else{
    // User is offline
}
```

## Add/Remove users

To add users to the contact list just use the method below:
```java
int userID = 56;

if (chatRoster.contains(userID)) {
    ...
    chatRoster.subscribe(userID);
    ...
} else {
    ...
    chatRoster.createEntry(userID, null);
    ...
}
```
After that user with **id = 56** will receive the request to be added to the contact list
```java
// QBSubscriptionListener
 
...

@Override
public void subscriptionRequested(int userId) {

}
```

To confirm the request:
```java
QBRoster chatRoster = ...;
chatRoster.confirmSubscription(userID);
```

To reject the request:
```java
QBRoster chatRoster = ...;
chatRoster.reject(userID);
```

To remove a previously added user from the contact list:
```java
int userID = 67;

QBRoster chatRoster = ...;

chatRoster.unsubscribe(userID);
```

## Custom status

A client MAY provide detailed status information to his contacts by constructing a presence object by himself:
```java
QBPresence presence = new QBPresence(QBPresence.Type.online, "I'm at home", 1, QBPresence.Mode.available);

chatRoster.sendPresence(presence);
```

In this case there is **no need to use** ```QBChatService.getInstance().startAutoSendPresence(60)```, you have to manage it by yourself.
